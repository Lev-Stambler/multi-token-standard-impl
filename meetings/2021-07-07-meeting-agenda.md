# Multi Token Standard Meeting - 7/7/21 9:30 PM UTC (2:30pm PDT/ 5:30pm EDT)

## Location 
TBA

### Background
We're here to discuss what we'd like to have happen with regards to representing semi-fungible tokens. The original thought was that we might create a standard that would be the erc-1155 of NEAR.

What makes ERC-1155 special? ERC-1155 has several features that are of note,approvals, batch transactions, and metadata that is exclusively specified outside of the contract. ERC-1155 relies on events to keep track of things like supply.


### What you should bring
- Yourself 
- Openess to ideas 
- Thoughts on the meeting goals 

### Agenda
- Brief intros - 1-2 minutes
- Meeting Goals
- Follow up steps

### Meeting Goals
- Understand the requirements for the multi-token standard. What we'd like to see. 
    - is it erc-1155 compatibility?
    - exchange listability?
    - partial ownership of NFTs?
    - wallet requirements?
    - ...
- Get clear on the shape of the standard
  - Should it be a completely new asset or should it be the composition of the existing standards ft or nft?
- Reach soft consensus on this or set a future date for further discussion.
