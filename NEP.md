- Proposal Name: multi-token
- Start Date: 2021/07/24

# Summary
[summary]: #summary

A standard interface for  a multi token standard that supports fungible, semi-fungible, and tokens of any type, allowing for ownership, transfer, and batch transfer of tokens generally regardless of specific type.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation
Having a single contract represent both NFTs and FTs can greatly improve efficiency as demonstrated by Enjin Coin. The ability to make batch requests with multiple asset classes can reduce a many transactions transaciton to a single transaction to trade around both NFTs and FTs that are a part of same token contract.

Having this will also increase Near's ability to work interoperably with other chains. This will reduce the complexity required to represent these emerging asset classes.

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

We should be able to do the following:
- Get balance of token per user
- Get balance in batch of a user
- Get supply of tokens per id
- Get supply of tokens in batch per id
- Represent non fungibility of tokens
- Represent fungibility of tokens
- Transfer tokens by id in batch
- Use these tokens on an exchange
- Refund storage costs for fungible tokens

There are a few concepts in the scenarios above:
- **Total supply**. It's the total number of tokens in circulation.
- **Balance owner**. An account ID that owns some amount of tokens.
- **Transfer**. Moves some amount from one account to another account.
- **Fungibility**. An indistinguishable amount of tokens to exchange 
- **Non Fungibility**. Tokens that are differentiable from each other.

### Real scenarios
 
#### Simple transfer

Alice wants to send 5 gold tokens to Bob.

Let's assume the following:
- The `gold` token is represented by the `games` with token_id `g133`.
- Alice's account is `alice`.
- Bob's account is `bob`.
- The precision for `gold` on the games contract is `10^8`. 
- The 5 tokens is `5 * 10^8` or as a number is `500000000`. 

High-level explanation:

Alice needs to issue one transaction to `games` contract to transfer 5 tokens (multiplied by precision) to Bob.
 
Technical calls:

1. `alice` calls `games::mt_transfer({"receiver_id": "bob", "amount": "500000000", "token_id": "g133"})`.

#### Simple batch transfer

Alice wants to send and a 1 unique(nft) gemstone, 5 gold and 10 silver tokens to Bob.

Let's assume the following:
- The unique nft `gem` token is represented by `games` with token_id
`uu2`
- The `gold` token is represented by the `games` with token_id `g133`.
- The `silver` token is represented by the `games` with token_id `s133`.
- Alice's account is `alice`.
- Bob's account is `bob`.
- The precision for `gold` on the games contract is `10^8`. 
- The precision for `silver` on the games contract is also `10^8`. 
- The 5 gold tokens is `5 * 10^8` or as a number is `500000000`. 
- The 10 silver tokens is `10 * 10^8` or as a number is `1000000000`. 
- The  1 gem token is `1` or as a number is `1`

High-level explanation:

Alice needs to issue one transaction to `games` contract to transfer 5 gold tokens and 10 silver tokens (multiplied by precision) and 1 gem to Bob.
 
Technical calls:

1. `alice` calls `games::mt_transfer_batch({"receiver_id": "bob", "amounts": ["500000000", "1000000000", "1"], "token_ids": ["g133", "s133", "uu2"]})`.



#### Token deposit to a contract 

Alice wants to deposit `gold` tokens to a compound interest contract to earn some rewards.

Let's assume the following:
- The `gold` token is represented  by the `games` contract with token_id `g133` .
- Alice's account is `alice`.
- The compound interest contract is `compound`.
- The precision on `gold` token is `10^18`. 
- The 1000 tokens is `1000 * 10^18` or as a number is `1000000000000000000000`. 
- The compound contract can work with many different token contracts and types.

High-level explanation:

Alice needs to issue a single transaction to `games` that will internally issue a cross contract call to `compound`. 

The initial transaction to `games` is made with `compound` as the receiver of a set token_ids and amounts from `alice`.

This call then waits on a response from `compound`. If `compound` responds with failure, the tx is aborted. 

Otherwise `games` contract accepts the results and resolves the promise completing the transaction.

- If transfer succeeded, `compound` can increase local ownership for `alice` to 1000 for `gold` token_id `g133`

- If transfer fails, `compound` doesn't need to do anything in current example, but maybe can notify `alice` of unsuccessful transfer.

Technical calls:
1. `alice` calls `games::mt_transfer_call({"receiver_id": "compound", amount: "1000000000000000000000", "token_id": "g133", msg: "interest-building"})`.
   During the `mt_transfer_call` call, `compound` does the following:
     fn mt_on_transfer(
        &mut self,
        sender_id: AccountId,
        token_ids: Vec<TokenId>,
        amounts: Vec<U128>,
        msg: String,
    ) -> PromiseOrValue<Vec<U128>>;
}
    1. calls `compound::mt_on_transfer({"sender_id": "alice", "token_ids":["g133"], "amounts": ["1000000000000000000000"], msg: "interest-building"})`.
    2. `compound` resolves the request/fails and `games` contract handles response from the promise with `games::mt_resolve_transfer` returning refunded amount if there is any or handling follow up from the result of compound cross contract call

#### Batch Token deposit to a contract 

Alice wants to deposit `silver` and `gold` tokens and the nft `gem` to a compound interest contract to earn some rewards. 

Let's assume the following:
- The `gold` token is represented  by the `games` contract with token_id `g133` .
- The `silver` token is represented  by the `games` contract with token_id `s133` .
- The `gem` unique only one nft token is represented  by the `games` contract with token_id `uu2` .
- Alice's account is `alice`.
- The compound interest contract is `compound`.
- The precision on `gold` token is `10^18`. 
- The precision on `silver` token is `10^18`. 
- The 1000 tokens is `1000 * 10^18` or as a number is `1000000000000000000000`. 
- The compound contract can work with many different token contracts and types.

High-level explanation:

Alice needs to issue a single transaction to `games` that will internally issue a cross contract call to `compound`. 

The initial transaction to `games` is made with `compound` as the receiver of a set token_ids and amounts from `alice`.

This call then waits on a response from `compound`. If `compound` responds with failure, the tx is aborted. 

Otherwise `games` contract accepts the results and resolves the promise completing the transaction.

- If transfer succeeded, `compound` can increase local ownership for `alice` to 1000 for `gold` token_id `g133`

- If transfer fails, `compound` doesn't need to do anything in current example, but maybe can notify `alice` of unsuccessful transfer.

Technical calls:
1. `alice` calls `games::mt_transfer_batch_call({"receiver_id": "compound", amounts: ["1000000000000000000000","1000000000000000000000", "1"], "token_ids": ["g133","s133","uu2"], msg: "interest-building"})`.
   During the `mt_transfer_call` call, `compound` does the following:
     fn mt_on_transfer(
        &mut self,
        sender_id: AccountId,
        token_ids: Vec<TokenId>,
        amounts: Vec<U128>,
        msg: String,
    ) -> PromiseOrValue<Vec<U128>>;
}
    1. calls `compound::mt_on_transfer({"sender_id": "alice", amounts: ["1000000000000000000000","1000000000000000000000", "1"], "token_ids": ["g133","s133","uu2"], msg: "interest-building"})`
    2. `compound` resolves the request/fails and `games` contract handles response from the promise with `games::mt_resolve_transfer` returning refunded amount if there is any or handling follow up from the result of compound cross contract call

### Receiver Trait
#### Notes
- TokenId is of type String
```
pub trait MultiTokenReceiver {
    /// Take some action after receiving a MultiToken-tokens token
    ///
    /// Requirements:
    /// * Contract MUST restrict calls to this function to a set of whitelisted MultiToken

        msg: String,
    ) -> PromiseOrValue<Vec<U128>>;
}
```
### Resolver Trait
#### Notes
- TokenId is of type String
```
/// Used when MultiTokens are transferred using `mt_transfer_call`. This is the method that's called after `mt_on_transfer`. This trait is implemented on the MultiToken contract.
pub trait MultiTokenResolver {
    /// Finalize an `mt_transfer_call` chain of cross-contract calls.

        amounts: Vec<U128>,
    ) -> Vec<U128>;
}
```
### Storage Management Trait
#### Notes
This is semi necessary for ft token types to be able to refund users for storage of many different token types like gold/silver... this might be slightly out of scope
```
pub trait StorageManagement {
    // if `registration_only=true` MUST refund above the minimum balance if the account didn't exist and
    //     refund full deposit if the account exists.
    fn storage_deposit(
        &mut self,
        token_ids: Vec<TokenId>,
        account_id: Option<AccountId>,
        registration_only: Option<bool>,
    ) -> StorageBalance;

    /// Withdraw specified amount of available â“ƒ for predecessor account.
    ///
    /// This method is safe to call. It MUST NOT remove data.
    ///
    /// `amount` is sent as a string representing an unsigned 128-bit integer. If
    /// omitted, contract MUST refund full `available` balance. If `amount` exceeds
    /// predecessor account's available balance, contract MUST panic.
    ///
    /// If predecessor account not registered, contract MUST panic.
    ///
    /// MUST require exactly 1 yoctoNEAR attached balance to prevent restricted
    /// function-call access-key call (UX wallet security)
    ///
    /// Returns the StorageBalance structure showing updated balances.
    fn storage_withdraw(&mut self, token_ids:Vec<TokenId>, amount: Option<U128>) -> StorageBalance;

    /// Unregisters the predecessor account and returns the storage NEAR deposit back.
    ///
    /// If the predecessor account is not registered, the function MUST return `false` without panic.
    ///
    /// If `force=true` the function SHOULD ignore account balances (burn them) and close the account.
    /// Otherwise, MUST panic if caller has a positive registered balance (eg token holdings) or
    ///     the contract doesn't support force unregistration.
    /// MUST require exactly 1 yoctoNEAR attached balance to prevent restricted function-call access-key call
    /// (UX wallet security)
    /// Returns `true` iff the account was unregistered.
    /// Returns `false` iff account was not registered before.
    fn storage_unregister(&mut self, token_ids:Vec<TokenId>, force: Option<bool>) -> Vec<bool>;

    fn storage_balance_bounds(&self, token_id:TokenId, account_id: Option<AccountId>) -> StorageBalanceBounds;
    fn storage_balance_bounds_batch(&self, token_id:Vec<TokenId>, account_id: Option<AccountId>) -> StorageBalanceBounds;

    fn storage_balance_of(&self, token_id:TokenId, account_id: AccountId) -> Option<StorageBalance>;
    fn storage_balance_of_batch(&self, token_ids:Vec<TokenId>, account_id: AccountId) -> Option<StorageBalance>;
}
```

### Metadata Trait
```
pub struct MultiTokenMetadata {
    pub spec: String,              // required, essentially a version like "nft-1.0.0"
    pub name: String,              // required, ex. "Mosaics"
    pub symbol: String,            // required, ex. "MOSIAC"
    pub icon: Option<String>,      // Data URL
    pub base_uri: Option<String>, // Centralized gateway known to have reliable access to decentralized storage assets referenced by `reference` or `media` URLs
    // supports metadata_uri interface that interpolates {id} in the string
    pub reference: Option<String>, // URL to a JSON file with more info
    pub reference_hash: Option<Base64VecU8>, // Base64-encoded sha256 hash of JSON from reference field. Required if `reference` is included.
}
/// Offers details on the contract-level metadata.
pub trait MultiTokenMetadataProvider {
    fn mt_metadata(&self) -> MultiTokenMetadata;
}
