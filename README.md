## Multi Token Standard Ref Impls

### About
This is a repo that is meant to spike ahead and see what can't be built to support a MultiToken Standard. 
The aim is that this will illuminate the challenges ahead, and act as a precursor to a PR to the current
near-sdk-rs standards repo. It will also be a kind of in tandem with any NEP that is developed.

### Where?
This repo is organized into feat branches and PRs. The PRs are highly incremental, and aim to allow people to follow,
the development as it goes along and be able to grok some of the decision making along the way. The code will live in
the feat branches until a particular direction is chosen and then that chosen branch will be merged into main.

### Meetings and Notes
There is a meetings folder that contains the meeting agenda, and then subsequent notes from that meeting.
Meetings will be announced on https://gov.near.org/t/multi-token-standard-discussion/2917. These are open to the public
